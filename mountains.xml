            <MountainType type="Dome Mountain">
                <Description>Dome mountains are formed when a large amount of melted rock (magma) pushes up through the earth's crust. Dome mountains aren't as tall as folded mountains because the magma beneath them doesn't press forcefully enough. The lava cools over time to form cold, hard rock. The outcome is a mountain with a dome form.</Description>
